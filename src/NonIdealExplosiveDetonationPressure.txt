Detonation pressure is the pressure generated at the front of a detonation wave in an explosive material.
 Non-ideal explosives, which do not follow the ideal detonation theory perfectly, 
 often have lower detonation pressures due to less efficient energy release and incomplete reactions at the
  detonation front. These explosives, usually less dense and more porous, show varying detonation velocities 
  and gradual pressure buildups. Factors such as chemical composition, initiation method, and environmental
   conditions play significant roles in influencing detonation pressure. Non-ideal explosives are commonly 
   used where controlled and less intense energy release is desired, such as in mining or demolition.
    Measurements of detonation pressure in these explosives involve complex empirical and computational models,
     modified by principles like the Chapman-Jouguet condition to account for their unique reaction dynamics.
